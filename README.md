and 'Done'. You can create tasks for your project by clicking on the add icon on the bottom right

start and pause the timer of a task once it's under the 'In Progress' column. When a task's state is
set to 'Done', you must enter the completion date of the task. You can drag and drop tasks by long
pressing them and moving them under the column you desire. you can view the task's details by
tapping on it , which will also give you the option to delete and edit it. you can export and
share a CSV file of the current state of the board, by tapping on the 'download' icon on the top
