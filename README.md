An app to create projects and track its tasks. In the first page you can view all your projects and
create new ones by clicking on the add button found in the bottom right corner of the page. You can
delete and edit your projects by swiping on them in the projects page. By tapping on each project,
you will be navigated to its board, consisting of tasks under three columns: 'To Do', 'In Progress',
and 'Done'. You can create tasks for your project by clicking on the add icon on the bottom right
corner of the app. Keep in mind that once you are in the create task page, you can tick the checkbox
on the bottom left corner of the page titled 'Create Another', which will allow you to keep creating
tasks without getting navigated back to the project board.
When a task's state is 'In Progress', you can track its time. You will be able to start and
pause the timer of a task once it's under the 'In Progress' column. When a task's state is set to '
Done', you must enter the completion date of the task. You can drag and drop tasks by long pressing
them and moving them under the column you desire. you can view the task's details by tapping on it ,
which will also give you the option to delete and edit it. you can export and share a CSV file of
the current state of the board, by tapping on the 'download' icon on the top right corner of the
page. Finally, you can change the app's theme by clicking on the palette icon found on the app bar (
present in every page). Have fun tracking your tasks!
